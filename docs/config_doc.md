# Details of configuration parameters for the package:
- **lag**: lag consideration between sequence patterns and anomalous windows
- **topk**: Top-k sequence patterns as output
- **output_type**: Output format between (`topk` patterns or using `threshold`)
- **data_file_path**: Full path of data input file (preferred to keep in the data folder)
- **output_file_path**: Full path of output file (preferred to keep in the data folder)
- **support_threshold**: Support threshold for sequence co-occurrence patterns
- **crossk_threshold**: Ripley's Cross-k threshold for sequence co-occurrence patterns
- **pattern_length**: length of feature sequences co-occurring with anomalous windows
- **split_columns**: list of columns that need to be same in a valid sequence. e.g. `pass` in OBD data. Can include multiple such columns. Leave list empty if none. 
These columns help induce the affect avoiding creation of sequences across multiple trips.
- **index_columns**: list of columns that need to be consecutive in a valid sequence. e.g. `Iteration` in OBD data. Can include multiple such columns. Leave list empty if none. These columns help eliminate gaps in readings due to faulty instruments. 
- **anomalous_window_length**: length of anomalous window
- **attribute_names**: Column names to generate candidate patterns off
- **attribute_min_values**: List of min. values for above attributes (as manually analysed from data). Only valid for `discrete_strategy="Manual"`.
- **attribute_bin_intervals**: List of bin intervals for above attributes (as manually analysed from data). Only valid for `discrete_strategy="Manual"`.
- **anomalous_target_column**: Column name to find anomalous windows off
- **anomalous_window_strategy**: 
    - *"Mean_Threshold"*: Checks if mean value of an anomalous window above threshold
- **anomalous_window_threshold**: value for anomalous target column to cross, to be a valid anomalous window
- **discrete_strategy**: Choice between `Denoise` and `Manual`. Manual would require explicit mention of `attribute_min_values` and `attribute_bin_intervals`, for each feature. `Denoise` would just require `n_bins`, and would do rest automatically.
- **n_bins**: Valid for discrete_strategy: `Denoise`. Automatically finds ranges within features to have `n` number of bins.
- **purning_type**: Choice between `[apriori, br-dr]`, both have same run-time, 'br-dr' does more enumerations but enumeration speed is faster due to UB pruning.
